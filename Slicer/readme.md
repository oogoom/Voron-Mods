Files to make your slicer have a tabbed bed and west3d black PEI images for prusaslicer/superslicer and similar variants.

Installation:
1) Go under printer settings, and click the SET button for bed shape.
2) Bed Size should be RECTANGULAR and set your size.  For some reason, when using a properly sized STL for this, it does not work properly.  I need to look into it!  
3) Under MODEL, Select the correct size for your printer.  Choose the file with MODEL in the name.
4) Under TEXTURE, click LOAD, and select the image file you want.
5) Click OK.

Your 3D view should now have a tabbed sheet preview.
