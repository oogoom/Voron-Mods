Some simple plugs for the corners of the extrusions.  Tolerances are TIGHT.  They are intended to be printed with TPU (Shore 95A), which gives you enough squish to get a snug fit and seal things up.  Though, ABS or PLA might work as well.  Give it a try and let me know?

Two plugs to go over the blind joints in each corner (total of 8 since the bottom corners don't need them).  These are designed to sit under the surface of the extrusion so they don't interfere with panels.

One plug to go through the blind joint access hole in each of the vertical extrusions (total of 8 for all 8 corners).  These are designed to push all the way through and sit flush with the extrusion channel depth so they don't interfere with any T-nuts or mounts you may have.
