Some simple plugs for the corners of the extrusions.  Tolerances are TIGHT.  They are intended to be printed with TPU (Shore 95A), which gives you enough squish to get a snug fit and seal things up.

Two plugs to go over the blind joints in each corner (total of 8 since the bottom corners don't need them).

1 plug to go through the blind joint access hole in each of the vertical extrusions (total of 8 for all 8 corners).
