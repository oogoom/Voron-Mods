Some simple plugs for the corners of the extrusions.  Tolerances are TIGHT.  They are intended to be printed with TPU (Shore 95A), which gives you enough squish to get a snug fit and seal things up.  The access hole plugs are made for 7.2mm diameter openings in the extrusions.  I was made aware that later LDO kits have smaller openings and these access hole plugs will not fit.  I imagine they can be scaled to the size of the hole, but I have not tried.  Also of note, the blind joint plugs will not work with stock panel clips without trimming them down in the slicer.  

Two plugs to go over the blind joints in each corner (total of 8 since the bottom corners don't need them).  These are designed to sit under the surface of the extrusion so they don't interfere with panels.

One plug to go through the blind joint access hole in each of the vertical extrusions (total of 8 for all 8 corners).  Install with the groove oriented vertically for best fit.  Picture below is of old plug without the flange.
