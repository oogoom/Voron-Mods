West3D Mainsail Theme

Mix and match however you like it. 

Choose between a brighter West3D green background or a darker version that is a bit easier on the eyes.  

The filenames describe what you'll get.  To get the full theme coverage, you'll want to have all four files:

custom.css
favicon-32x32.png
sidebar-background.png
sidebar-logo.png

Choose your desired look and rename the corresponding files accordingly.  Previews are shown below.
