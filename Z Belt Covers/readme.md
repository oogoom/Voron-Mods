Modified Z belt covers for Voron 2.4r2.

4 types of files:
1) Standard belt cover
2) USB belt cover - small circular hole for routing through a usb wire or the like
3) FFC belt cover - small slot for sliding an FFC/ribbon cable through to route into the electronics bay.
4) Slot Cover - print 4 to cover the gap between the belts.  It will be a tight tolerance fit!

Pick whichever you want and mirror in your slicer as needed!
