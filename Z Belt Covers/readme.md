Modified Z belt covers for Voron 2.4r2.

3 types of files:
1) Standard belt cover (can be mirrored for both sides)
2) USB belt cover - small circular hole for routing through a usb wire or the like
3) FFC belt cover - small slot for sliding an FFC/ribbon cable through to route into the electronics bay.

1 type of cover file:
Just need to print 4 of the cover insert.  Should be a tight tolerance fit!

Pick whichever you want and mirror in your slicer as needed!
