### **DISCLAIMER:** This is not a perfect tracking system.  Currently, it only tracks the total duration of a print job (i.e., heatsoak time + printing time).  It does not track extra time for delayed gcode filter shutoff and it does not track total number of days since refreshing the filter media (e.g., 30 days).  I am hoping to add both these things in the future, so check back soon<sup>tm</sup>?

These macros help you track the number of hours your filter media has been used and gives a simple M117 reminder when the tracked hours exceeds a predefined maximum.

### REQUIRED:

[save_variables] config section must be added to your printer.cfg.  Your path must be defined.  Use whatever path it is to your klipper config.  The example below is shown with the default path for Klipper since last year.  Older versions of Klipper will have a different path.  This config section will enable saving variables to a file (e.g., variables.cfg) that will allow variables and their values to be saved across restarts.  The filename can be changed to whatever you choose.

```
#######################################
#  VARIABLE SAVING
#######################################
[save_variables]
filename: ~/printer_data/config/variables.cfg
```

Once [save_variables] has been added to your printer.cfg, you can add these macros as well.  

[FILTER_ALERT_CHECK] does error checking and alerting.  This is to deal with a quirk where the variable value doesn't seem to update immediately for use until another macro is called. Also, includes support for moonraker notifier.  Alerts are displayed in M117 status as well as the console.  Hopefully, you see one of them but feel free to comment out whichever you don't want.

[FILTER_RESET] resets the hour counter and is where you can define your desired maximum hours.  It is a float value to reflect print jobs less than 1 hour.  Change the maxhours value to whatever you wish.  This macro should be run every time you change your filter media.  It will call FILTER_ALERT_CHECK to display an M117 status message once complete or an error if something went wrong.

[FILTER_TIME] simply displays the currently tracked hour counter value.  Quick way to see how close you are to reaching your max.

[FILTER_ADD_TIME] does all the tracking.  Takes the total_duration of the recently completed print job and adds it to the value stored for the hourcounter variable.  Note that print jobs that are cancelled or fail and do not produce print_stats values for total_duration are not tracked.  Call this in your [PRINT_END] macro.  Calls FILTER_ALERT_CHECK to check if hour counter exceeds the max and alerts if it is.  If you use delayed gcode to turn off your fans, send the duration value (which is in seconds) when calling this macro in the DELAY parameter.  For example, 

```
# Calls macro with the delayed_gcode duration value of 1800 seconds (i.e., 30 minutes)
FILTER_ADD_TIME DELAY=1800
```
If you don't use delayed gcode, then simply call FILTER_ADD_TIME without the DELAY parameter.

### INSTALLATION
Copy and paste these macros into your printer.cfg or whatever file you keep your macros in.
